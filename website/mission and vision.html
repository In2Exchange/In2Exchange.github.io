  <h1>Mission and Vision</h1>
  <p>To teach all children the importance of loving to learn and the greatness of learning to love.</p>

  <p>Each individual is unique, provided with varied patterns of growth and development with different learning habits, skills values and
  attitudes.</p>
   
  <p>Considering this principle, KIDS CHOICE offers programs and enjoyable experience for the child to:</p>
   
  <p>Have time to find out about things and to master new skills.
  Be more creatives, sociable and alert.
  Have challenges that are just beyond their present level of accomplishment.</p>

  <p>Our Pre-School Education program provides:</p>

  <p>Individualized curriculum where the child is the center of learning process.
  Well equipped learning materials to help stimulate childs mental ability.
  Instruction and supervision from highly qualified teaching staff.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, KCM Academy produces OUTSTANDING STUDENTS</p>

  <p>Some of our graduates are now honor students of big schools like De La Salle-Zobel,
  Colegio de San Agustin and others.
  Other KCMA students skip PREPARATORY level because they were accelerated to First grade.
  At NURSERY level, our students learn to read basic words.</p>
