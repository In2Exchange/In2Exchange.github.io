          <h3>1. Write a brief introduction about yourself.</h3>
          <p>I’m Bryan Funcion,  I’ll be 18 years old in a couple of days and I live in Brgy Don Bosco Paranaque.
          I have studied in KCM since pre-school thus most of the teachers know me.    
          Even my siblings studied in KCM, our eldest is now in college taking up BS Animation while my other sister is about to graduate from Junior High school this year.  
          I like reading online articles, cooking and watching online movies.  
          More than interacting with anyone,   I would prefer being alone and just read articles which interest me . 
          The articles that I usually read are historical articles and at times, news articles.</p>

          <h3>2. Why did you enroll as an ICT student? Why not other tracks or strands?</h3>
          <p>I enrolled in ICT because the school recommended me to take this strand.  
          Maybe because the teachers already know me, my skill set, attitude and aptitude level since I‘ve been with them since preschool they  believe I suit this track. They advised me and my mom thus when my mom explained to me what the school's recommendation is, I decided to give it a try.  
          But if I were to be asked,  I want to try ABM because I like to try accounting since I have quite good skills when it comes with numbers.</p>

          <h3>3. What is your dream job? How do you think this course will help you in pursuing your career?</h3>
          <p>Since I’m good with numbers and quite analytical I plan to enter the world of accountancy.   
          I believe having access to the right tools , programs and or platforms mining data will be much easier.  
          Like for example through proper programs set comparing financial performance of companies month on month or month compared to the same month as of the previous year to determine growth rate or losses can be done easily.  
          This will be  beneficial to check as to how far one is  meeting the targets set, and from there come up with strategic decisions in attaining the set targets as the need arises.  
          WIth accurate and easy access to such data , board of directors can also make more decisive decisions pertaining to investments that need to be made.  
          Analytical skills matched with proper tools plus good oral communication skills will surely be a great combination to excel in this field as one would be able to cohesively explain the data at hand, as well projections made.  
          Being able to have such data is very important as this can greatly impact a company’s present and future state.</p>

          <h3>4. To whom are you dedicating your success in finishing the course? Yourself, family, friends, special someone etc. Why?</h3>
          <p>When the time comes that I finished this course,  I will be dedicating my success to myself.  
          I say to myself because I know how much I have worked hard to attain this goal. I have pushed myself to the edge in order to be able to accomplish all the tasks given to me, submit them on time  and develop the  skills needed for the field of discipline that  I plan to enter. 
          All the sacrifices that I have made and will be making will be paid off as I reach the end of the line in completing this course.  
          A nd I know as I try to reach the end, people along the way have helped me one way or another like my mom, teachers, mentor and God thus in a way I also would like to thank them and dedicate this success to them.</p>

        <h3>5. Favorite Movies</h3>
        <p>My favorite movies are usually Marvel movies like Avengers, Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, Doctor Strnage , Ant Man, Guardians of the Galaxy and Black Panther.  I'm more into Marvels than to DCs. 
           I like the way as to how each story per movie is connected with one another.  I also find it amusing as to how they always find a way to have a scene were the creator of the Marvels who is Stanley to be part of each movie. 
           I don't get tired of watching any of them, even thoough I have watched them in theaters I would still watched them whenever they are being played in cable.</p>
